PyScripter-Color-Schemes
========================
###Color Schemes for PyScripter IDE

This repo contains some DARK and LIGHT COLOR SCHEMES for PyScripter IDE
(An IDE for Python Windows platform only).

Steps for using the color schemes:

1. Download this color scheme repo **(You must have installed [Python](https://www.python.org/download) and
[PyScripter](https://code.google.com/p/pyscripter))**.

2. Open PyScripter. In the **Menu bar**, find and click `Tools > Options >
Import/Export > Import Highlighters`.

3. Browse to the PyScripter color scheme folder you have just
downloaded; choose the color scheme (INI files) and click open.
That's it!

As there are few color schemes for PyScripter; I chose to make this
repo. You are most welcome to use your imagination and add more color
schemes.

Thank you!
