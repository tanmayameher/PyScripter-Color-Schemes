#Color Schemes for PyScripter IDE

This repo contains some DARK and LIGHT COLOR SCHEMES for PyScripter IDE
(An IDE for Python Windows platform only).
Steps for using the color schemes.
1. Download the color scheme folder (You must have installed Python and
PyScripter)
2. Open PyScripter, Goto "Main Menu"  and click Tools > Options >
Import/Export > Import Highlighters.
3. Browse to the PyScripter color scheme folder you have just
downloaded; choose the color scheme (INI files) and click open.
That's it!
As there are few color schemes for PyScripter; I chose to make this
repo. You are most welcome to use your imagination and add more color
schemes.
Thank you!
